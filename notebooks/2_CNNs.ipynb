    "In this practical, we will implement variants of modern CNN architectures. There have been many different architectures been proposed over the past few years. Some of the most impactful ones, and still relevant today, are the following: [GoogleNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842)/Inception architecture (winner of ILSVRC 2014), [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) (winner of ILSVRC 2015), and [DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) (best paper award CVPR 2017). All of them were state-of-the-art models when being proposed, and the core ideas of these networks are the foundations for most current state-of-the-art architectures. Thus, it is important to understand these architectures and learn how to implement some of them.\n",

PyTorch Lightning is a framework that simplifies your code needed to train, evaluate, and test a model in PyTorch. It also handles logging into [TensorBoard](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/tensorboard_tutorial.html), a visualization toolkit for ML experiments, and saving model checkpoints automatically with minimal code overhead from our side. This is extremely helpful for us as we want to focus on implementing different model architectures and spend little time on other code overhead. Note that at the time of writing/teaching, the framework has been released in version 1.6. Future versions might have a slightly changed interface and thus might not work perfectly with the code (we will try to keep it up-to-date as much as possible). \n",

    "## Part 1: ResNet\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the practical, you will implement a small ResNet. The [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) paper is one of the  [most cited AI papers](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/google-scholar-reveals-most-influential-papers-research-citations-twenty-twenty), and has been the foundation for neural networks with more than 1,000 layers. Despite its simplicity, the idea of residual connections is highly effective as it supports stable gradient propagation through the network. Instead of modeling $x_{l+1}=F(x_{l})$, we model $x_{l+1}=x_{l}+F(x_{l})$ where $F$ is a non-linear mapping (usually a sequence of NN modules likes convolutions, activation functions, and normalizations). If we do backpropagation on such residual connections, we obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial x_{l+1}}{\\partial x_{l}} = \\mathbf{I} + \\frac{\\partial F(x_{l})}{\\partial x_{l}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias towards the identity matrix guarantees a stable gradient propagation being less effected by $F$ itself. There have been many variants of ResNet proposed, which mostly concern the function $F$, or operations applied on the sum. In this tutorial, we look at two of them: the original ResNet block, and the [Pre-Activation ResNet block](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027). We visually compare the blocks below (figure credit - [He et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027)):\n",
    "\n",
    "<center width=\"100%\"><img src=\"figures/resnet_block.svg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"300px\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The original ResNet block applies a non-linear activation function, usually ReLU, after the skip connection. In contrast, the pre-activation ResNet block applies the non-linearity at the beginning of $F$. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. For very deep network, however, the pre-activation ResNet has shown to perform better as the gradient flow is guaranteed to have the identity matrix as calculated above, and is not harmed by any non-linear activation applied to it. For comparison, in this notebook, we implement both ResNet types as shallow networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this practical, we will use the Pre-Activation ResNet block. The visualization above already shows what layers are included in $F$. One special case we have to handle is when we want to reduce the image dimensions in terms of width and height. The ResNet block requires $F(x_{l})$ to be of the same shape as $x_{l}$. Thus, we need to change the dimensionality of $x_{l}$ as well before adding to $F(x_{l})$. The original implementation used an identity mapping with stride 2 and padded additional feature dimensions with 0. However, the more common implementation is to use a 1x1 convolution with stride 2 as it allows us to change the feature dimensionality while being efficient in parameter and computation cost. Let's try to implement the ResNet block below:"
